			<h2 class="txt2"> What is Minecraft?
				</h2>
			<p2 class="txt" >Minecraft is a sandbox 3D blocky survival game, with virtually infinite terrain, where players may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world.

			<p2 class="txt" >Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing <a target="" href="#history">versions</a>, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020. The original edition of Minecraft, now known as the Java Edition, was first developed in May 2009. Persson released a test video on YouTube of an early version of Minecraft. The base program of Minecraft was completed by Persson over a weekend in that month and a private testing was released on TigIRC on 16 May 2009. The game was first released as a developmental release on TIGSource forums.

			<p3 class="txt" >The first major update, dubbed Alpha, was released on 30 June 2010. Although Persson maintained a day job with Jalbum.net at first, he later quit in order to work on Minecraft full-time as sales of the alpha version of the game expanded.[105] Persson continued to update the game with releases distributed to users automatically. These updates included new items, new blocks, new mobs, survival mode, and changes to the game's behavior (e.g. how water flows). Consecutive updates included: <br>

			<p2 class="txt" >In July 2010, PC Gamer listed Minecraft as the fourth-best game to play at work. In September 2019, The Guardian classified Minecraft as the best video game of (the first two decades of) the 21st century, and in November 2019 Polygon called the game the "most important game of the decade" in its 2010s "decade in review".[292] In December 2019, Forbes gave Minecraft a special mention in a list of the best video games of the 2010s, stating that the game is "without a doubt one of the most important games of the last ten years." In June 2020, Minecraft was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.<br>
			Minecarft is not just another game that is played a bit and forgotten, it has sparked and nurtured the imagination of a whole generation of children. It is also a place for architects to test out buildings and designs, and as a way to practice structural design.<br>
			Minecraft is recognized as one of the first successful games to use an early access model to draw in sales prior to its full release version to help fund development. As Minecraft helped to bolster indie game development in the early 2010s, it also helped to popularize the use of the early access model in indie game development. The rise of indie game development is good not only for people wanting to play video games, but also game developpers, because now there is an increased demand for small indie games, that are easy enough for one person to make and can generate a decent amount of income.
